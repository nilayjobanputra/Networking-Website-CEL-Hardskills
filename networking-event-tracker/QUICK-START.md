# 🚀 EventTracker Quick Start Guide

## What You Built
A **real-time networking intelligence platform** that solves the core networking identification problem with:

✅ **Real-time attendance dashboard** - See who's present live
✅ **Interactive venue mapping** - Visual attendee locations
✅ **Interest-based matching** - Smart networking recommendations
✅ **Mobile-responsive design** - Works on all devices

## Immediate Demo Steps

### 1. Your App is Already Running!
- Open: http://localhost:3000
- See the EventTracker dashboard with navigation tabs

### 2. Set Up Firebase (5 minutes)
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create project: "eventtracker-demo"
3. Enable Firestore in test mode
4. Copy config to `frontend/src/firebase.ts`

### 3. Add Demo Data
```javascript
// In browser console (F12):
import('./src/utils/demoData.js').then(m => m.seedDemoData())
```

### 4. Record Your Demo Video
- Use the script in `docs/demo-video-script.md`
- Show both Dashboard and Venue Map tabs
- Highlight real-time features and spatial intelligence
