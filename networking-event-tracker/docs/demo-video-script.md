# EventTracker Demo Video Script
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

## Scene 1: Problem Setup (15 seconds)
**[Voice-over with split screen showing confused people at networking event]**

*"Networking events have a major problem - attendees walk around blindly, not knowing who's present, where people are located, or how to identify relevant connections. This leads to missed opportunities and awkward interactions."*

**Visual:** Show people wandering around a networking event looking lost and checking name tags

## Scene 2: Solution Introduction (10 seconds)
**[Screen recording starts - open browser to localhost:3000]**

*"EventTracker solves this with real-time networking intelligence."*

**Visual:** Clean landing on EventTracker dashboard

## Scene 3: Live Dashboard Demo (30 seconds)
**[Screen recording: Dashboard tab]**

*"The live dashboard shows exactly who's present in real-time."*

**Actions to show:**
1. Point to the statistics: "X Currently Present, Y Total Registered"
2. Scroll through attendee cards showing:
   - Names, job titles, companies
   - Interest tags (AI/ML, Startups, etc.)
   - Check-in times with green status indicators
3. Show recent activity feed

*"Each person's profile shows their interests, making it easy to identify relevant connections before you even approach them."*

## Scene 4: Venue Map Demo (30 seconds)
**[Screen recording: Switch to Venue Map tab]**

*"The venue map provides spatial intelligence - see exactly where people are located within the event space."*

**Actions to show:**
1. Show interactive map with attendee dots
2. Click on an attendee marker to show popup with:
   - Name, role, interests
   - "Send Connection Request" button
3. Show sidebar with nearby recommendations
4. Demonstrate the distance indicators ("~25m away")

*"This eliminates random wandering - you can strategically navigate to connect with the right people."*

## Scene 5: Key Innovation Highlight (15 seconds)
**[Split screen: Dashboard + Map]**

*"EventTracker goes beyond basic directories by combining real-time presence tracking, spatial intelligence, and interest matching - giving you everything you need to network efficiently."*

## Scene 6: Impact Summary (10 seconds)
**[Close on EventTracker logo/brand screen]**

*"Transform your networking from random encounters to strategic connections. EventTracker - real-time networking intelligence."*

## Recording Tips

### Pre-Recording Setup
1. **Seed demo data**: Run `seedDemoData()` in browser console
2. **Browser setup**:
   - Clear cache and cookies
   - Full screen browser (hide bookmarks bar)
   - Good resolution: 1920x1080 minimum
3. **Multiple attendees**: Show 6-8 people in various states (present/not present)

### Screen Recording Best Practices
- **Smooth cursor movements** - move slowly and deliberately
- **Pause between actions** - give viewers time to absorb information
- **Highlight clicks** - use cursor highlight or zoom effects
- **Clean browser** - close unnecessary tabs

### Voice-Over Tips
- **Clear, confident delivery** - you're solving a real problem
- **Match pace to visuals** - don't rush through demos
- **Emphasize key benefits**: real-time, spatial intelligence, interest matching
- **Professional but approachable tone**

### Technical Demo Flow
1. Start at dashboard (shows immediate value)
2. Highlight real-time nature (green indicators, timestamps)
3. Show interest-based discovery (tags, recommendations)
4. Switch to map (spatial intelligence wow factor)
5. Demonstrate person lookup and connection workflow
6. End with value proposition summary

### Backup Plans
- If Firebase isn't working: Use static demo data
- If map doesn't load: Focus on dashboard features
- If real-time breaks: Explain the concept with existing data

## Post-Production
- **Add captions** for accessibility
- **Smooth transitions** between dashboard and map
- **Highlight UI elements** with subtle animations
- **Professional thumbnail** with EventTracker logo
- **Clear call-to-action** at the end
