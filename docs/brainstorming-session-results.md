# Brainstorming Session Results: Networking Mixer Digital Solution

**Session Date:** 2025-09-29
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary ðŸ“Š
**Participant:** College Project Team

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** Digital solutions for networking identification at mixer events

**Session Goals:** Generate implementable ideas for college project with GitHub repository submission within 1 day

**Project Context:**
- Platform: Web and mobile
- Deliverables: GitHub repo + 1-2min video demo + documentation
- Evaluation: Problem-solution fit, technical implementation, UX, innovation

**Techniques Used:** First Principles Thinking, SCAMPER Method (S-C-A-M)

**Total Ideas Generated:** 8 core concepts

## Key Themes Identified:
- Real-time participant tracking and availability
- Spatial intelligence within venue
- Personal/professional nature discovery and matching

## First Principles Analysis - Core Problems Identified:

1. **Information Availability Gap:** No real-time data on who has arrived/departed
2. **Spatial Awareness Gap:** No understanding of participant location within venue
3. **Personal Nature Gap:** No insight into attendees' backgrounds, interests, goals

## SCAMPER Ideation Session

### S - Substitute (Traditional Check-in/Name Tags)
**Mobile Phone Integration Solutions:**
1. **Mobile-linked dynamic profiles** - Phones become the "smart name tag"
2. **Google Maps-style venue navigation** - Replace physical venue maps with interactive mobile venue maps
3. **Location-based people matching** - Replace random wandering with intelligent proximity-based recommendations

### C - Combine (Merge Technologies/Concepts)
**Powerful Combinations:**
1. **Real-time chat + location matching + mutual interest verification** - Instant messaging with nearby people who share interests, eliminating awkward cold approaches
   - *Implementation: LinkedIn-style connection requests with accept/reject for in-person meetups*

### A - Adapt (From Other Industries)
**Cross-Industry Adaptations:**
1. **LinkedIn connection system â†’ Real-time networking** - Send connection requests to nearby attendees, get accepted before approaching physically

### M - Modify (Scale, Timing, Format)
**Timing & Format Modifications:**
1. **Micro-networking sessions** - Scheduled 5-minute focused conversations instead of random wandering
2. **Pre-event digital introductions** - Connect and plan meetings before arriving at venue

## Implementation Focus: Core Problem Prioritization

**PRIMARY TARGETS (User Selected):**
1. **No real-time data on who has arrived/departed**
2. **No understanding of participant location within venue**

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities
*Ideas ready to implement now*

1. **Real-Time Event Dashboard**
   - Description: Web/mobile app showing live attendee check-in status and venue location
   - Why immediate: Uses basic geolocation + simple database, minimal AI needed
   - Resources needed: Basic web dev stack, GPS API, real-time database

2. **Venue Mapping with Attendee Dots**
   - Description: Interactive venue map showing attendee locations as moving dots (like Find My Friends)
   - Why immediate: Combines GPS tracking with venue floor plan overlay
   - Resources needed: Mapping API, real-time location updates, venue layout data

### Future Innovations
*Ideas requiring development/research*

1. **AI-Powered Interest Matching + Location**
   - Description: Machine learning algorithm that suggests optimal networking paths based on location + interests
   - Development needed: ML model training, natural language processing for interest extraction
   - Timeline estimate: 2-4 weeks for MVP

2. **LinkedIn-Style Live Connection System**
   - Description: Send connection requests to nearby people before approaching physically
   - Development needed: Real-time messaging, user verification, notification systems
   - Timeline estimate: 1-2 weeks for basic version

### Moonshots
*Ambitious, transformative concepts*

1. **AR Networking Overlays**
   - Description: Augmented reality showing attendee info when pointing phone at people
   - Transformative potential: Completely eliminates networking anxiety and awkwardness
   - Challenges to overcome: AR technology complexity, privacy concerns, device compatibility

## Action Planning

### #1 Priority: **EventTracker MVP** (Real-time attendance + location)
- Rationale: Solves your two key problems directly, technically feasible in 1 day
- Next steps:
  1. Create simple check-in system (QR codes/manual)
  2. Build real-time dashboard showing who's present
  3. Add basic venue map with attendee location dots
- Resources needed: React/Vue.js, Firebase/real-time DB, basic mapping API
- Timeline: 6-8 hours for working prototype

### #2 Priority: **Smart Venue Navigator**
- Rationale: Builds on #1, adds Google Maps-style navigation within venue
- Next steps:
  1. Upload venue floor plan
  2. Add location-based recommendations
  3. Implement search/filter by interests
- Resources needed: Mapping library, floor plan digitization
- Timeline: 4-6 hours additional development

### #3 Priority: **Pre-Connection System**
- Rationale: Innovation differentiator for evaluation criteria
- Next steps:
  1. Add user profiles with interests
  2. Build connection request system
  3. Create mutual matching algorithm
- Resources needed: User authentication, messaging system
- Timeline: 6-8 hours for basic version
